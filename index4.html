            <h3> From forest to Cabinet Minister</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fascinating member of Telangana cabinet is Maoist-turned-MLA Danasari Anasuya, popularly known as Seethakka, whom Chief Minister Revanth Reddy calls his "sister". As someone who took up arms and renounced it, Seethakka's mission is to arm youngsters with access to education, so they can rewrite their future.
                Her journey from armed revolution to a minister with a law degree -- in October last year she earned a PhD -- has stirred the imagination of the masses. So much so that when the new Congress government was taking oath at Hyderabad's LB Stadium on Thursday, the loudest cheers were reserved for her.
                
                The 52-year-old tribal MLA from Mulugu has been entrusted with three crucial ministries -- panchayat raj, rural development and women & child welfare.</p>

              <h1>Mla to Cabinet Minsiter</h1>
              <p>&nbsp;Seethakka completed her primary and secondary education at the Mulugu Government Girls Residential School. “We did not have enough means. So she had to study in a government school with a hostel facility,” her mother Sarakka said. After completing class 10, Seethakka joined the CPI (ML) Janashakti party in 1988 and dedicated her life to fighting against class and caste oppression. Recalling her childhood, her cousin Venkanna said, “From a young age, she was a rebel. It was not surprising when she went into the forest [to take up arms]. She would fight for quality food even during her hostel days.”

                Danasari Anasuya was rechristened Seetha when she joined Maoist ranks – the name was deemed appropriate by other Maoists as her husband’s name was Ramu (Kunja Ramu). Ramu, who was her cousin and also a member of Janashakti, was one of the reasons behind her joining the far-Left CPI (ML) party. Even though the couple later parted ways, they were once considered the ideal match. </p>
